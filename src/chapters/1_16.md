Yes, it's as scary as it sounds. Maybe not.

`->` You can forcefully push changes by using the `--force` or `-f` flag with
`git push`.

<!-- pause -->

`->` They take optional `commit ids` if you want to force push a
`particular
commit` or `a range of commits`.

<!-- pause -->

`->` You should generally **AVOID** force pushing to `shared branches` as it
often diverges `history`.

<!-- pause -->

`->` So, no `force pushing` to the `main branch`!

<!-- pause -->

`->` But, it's fine to `force push` commits to your `own development branch`.

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_lines: 2 -->

`->` To add, modern Git has a safer alternative to `--force` called
`--force-with-lease`.

<!-- pause -->

`->` It's a `conditional push` that prevents `accidentally overwriting work`
that `other team members` have pushed in the meantime.

# 1.3. Okay, what's the difference?

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

Well, take a look at this `pretty table` for a change (literally):

<!-- new_line -->

```file +render
path: ../visuals/1_3_snapshot_patch_file_tree_table.typ
language: typst
```

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

What is the `observation`?

<!-- new_line -->
<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- `Snapshot-based` VCS store the `state` of the changes.
- `Patch-based` VCS store the `patches applied` or `operations` made by changes.
- `File-based` or `Tree-based` VCS store the `deltas` or `differences` made by
  changes.
  - `File-based` VCS tracks changes at the level of `individual files`.
  - `Tree-based` VCS tracks changes at the level of an `entire directory tree`,
    not just individual files.

<!-- new_lines: 2 -->

~~<span style="color:red;">Btw, on the note of patch-based systems, the
mathematics behind the theory of patches uses CRDTs...</span>~~ Let's not!

# 1.7. Your first porcelain command.

The first step is to create a repository (or _repo_ for short).

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

````typst +render
#import "@preview/catppuccin:1.0.0": catppuccin, flavors
#show: catppuccin.with(flavors.mocha)
#set text(font: "Maple Mono NF", size: 14pt)

```fish
# Initialize a Git repo.
git init <project>

# Change directory to the newly created repo.
cd <project>

# Check the content of the directory.
ls -a
# or, you could just open this directory in your file manager.
```

So, what is the `observation`?

<!-- new_line -->
<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- A `.git` directory inside the project (`TIP:` turn on hidden files, if you
  haven't already).
- The `.git` directory contains a lot of gibberish (`TODO:` things will make a
  lot more sense as we progress).
- ...and that's pretty much it, for now.

<!-- new_line -->
<!-- incremental_lists: false -->

`->` This is the `repository` for this particular project.

<!-- pause -->

`->` i.e. Git will store your `project files`, and `changes made to these files`
over time inside this `.git` directory.

<!-- pause -->

`->` We'll briefly look into the `inner workings` of Git, to make the picture
clear.

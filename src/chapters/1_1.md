# 1.1. So, what is Version Control?

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

`Version Control (VC, VCS)` is a system that `records changes` to `a file` or
`set of files` over time, so you can `recall specific versions` later.

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

```file +render
path: ../diagrams/1_1_vc_1.mermaid
language: mermaid
```

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

Now, at `any point` you can:

```file +render
path: ../diagrams/1_1_vc_2.mermaid
language: mermaid
```

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

What if there are `multiple people` in the mix?

<!-- new_line -->

```file +render
path: ../diagrams/1_1_vc_3.mermaid
language: mermaid
```

<!-- new_line -->
<!-- pause -->

`->` A VCS helps you make sense of this `chaos` and `sync everyone's changes`
without having to do things `manually`.

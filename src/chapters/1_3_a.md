# 1.3. Okay, what's the difference?

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

Well, take a look at this `pretty table` for a change (literally):

<!-- new_line -->

```file +render
path: ../visuals/1_3_snapshot_patch_file_tree_table.typ
language: typst
```

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

So, what's the `observation`?

<!-- new_line -->
<!-- pause -->

- `Snapshot-based` VCS store the `state` introduced by changes.
  - e.g. include `Git`, `Mercurial`, `Jujutsu` etc.

<!-- new_lines: 2 -->
<!-- pause -->

- `Patch-based` VCS store the `patches applied` or `operations` made by changes.
  - e.g. include `Darcs`, `Pijul`, etc. (`NOTE:` i don't think i've heard of
    anything else)

<!-- new_lines: 2 -->
<!-- pause -->

- `Delta-based` VCS store the `deltas` or `differences` made by changes.
  - e.g. include `Apache Subversion (SVN)`, `Perforce (Helix Core)`, etc.

<!-- pause -->

`->` Btw, on the note of `patch-based systems`, the `mathematics` behind the
`theory
of patches` uses `CRDTs`...

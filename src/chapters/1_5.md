# For Linux, you can either use your distribution's package manager e.g. pacman:
sudo pacman -S git
# or, use Homebrew (recommended for most people):
brew install git
# If my people (Nix folks) are present here, you already know your ways ;P

# For macOS, you can either use Homebrew (recommended):
brew install git
# or, use MacPorts:
sudo port install git
# NOTE: Apple ships a binary package of Git with Xcode.

# For Windows, use winget (recommended):
winget install --id Git.Git -e

Visit [Git's download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for more information.
For some reason, if you want to download the Git binaries manually, this is your
place.

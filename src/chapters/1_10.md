# 1.10. Committing files.

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

It's about time we `commit` the changes we made.

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

```file +render
path: ../visuals/1_10_git_commit.typ
language: typst
```

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

So, what is the `observation`?

<!-- new_line -->
<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Each `commit` saves a snapshot of the `state` of the repository.
- Each `commit` holds a unique id, also known as `commit id` which can be used
  to refer this particular commit in future.
- We can browse our `commit history` using `git log` which includes metadata
  like `author`, `date`, etc.

<!-- new_line -->
<!-- incremental_lists: false -->

`->` To note, the order of `commits` matter in Git!

<!-- pause -->

`->` One important consequence of this implementation is called
`commit chaining`, which can easily detect `fabricated history`.

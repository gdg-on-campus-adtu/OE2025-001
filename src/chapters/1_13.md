# 1.13. Merging.

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

Assume, we've built a feature in a `branch` which is now ready to go in the
`main branch`. What do we do?

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

`->` One of the things we can do is a `branch merge` or simply `merge`.

<!-- pause -->

`->` Merging a branch onto another branch applies the changes made in the
`temporary branch` into the `main branch`.

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

Here is how it looks in the command line:

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

```file +render
path: ../visuals/1_13_git_branch_merge.typ
language: typst
```

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

Important things to note:

<!-- new_line -->
<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Merges can either happen `cleanly`, or have `conflicts`.
- In case of conflicts, you have two options: `resolve the conflicts` or
  `abort the merge` (using `--abort`).
- There are various flavors of merges, but today we'll mostly encounter
  `Fast-Forward` and `Three-Way` merges.
- `Fast-Forward`-able merges are **ALWAYS** `conflict-free`.

<!-- new_line -->
<!-- incremental_lists: false -->

`->` To keep the session simple, we'll only look at resolving conflicts using a
`forge UI` later.

<!-- pause -->

`->` Maybe you could use your intuition to explain how that would map to
`local resolution`?

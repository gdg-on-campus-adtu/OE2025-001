<!-- new_line -->

Oh, this is gonna be an `important one`.

ignore them.

<!-- pause -->

`->` Yes, it is that simple!

<!-- pause -->

`->` You might ask, `"But, what's the use-case?"`

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

Well, that's a good question!

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

`->` This is the place where you add your `secrets` or `junk` (e.g.
`build artifacts`) to get ignored.

<!-- pause -->

`->` Nothing in-between.

<!-- new_line -->

`->` Like seriously, did you ever commit your `node_modules` directory or leak
your `API` key?

<!-- pause -->

`->` Just for `GitHub` to notify you that your kept your backdoor open!

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

Well anyway, here is a glimpse at how it looks like:

<!-- new_line -->

```file +render
path: ../visuals/1_14_git_ignore.typ
language: typst
```

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

`->` Phew, tired anybody? We've covered a lot of material so far.
